I also learned some computer science concepts that honed my ability to write efficient algorithms. On the front-end, I have extensive experience with the React framework and Redux. I can write clean components, manage state globally, and utilize hooks for rendering. In fact, this protfolio was written with React! I have utilized Jest to undergo unit tests and learned to code with a test-driven development mindset. For user authentication I use JSON Web Tokens (JWT). I can sign and decipher tokens and build middleware to check the userâ€™s status.'

My APIs function in tandem with either SQL or NoSQL databases, specifically Sequelize/MySQL and Mongoose/MongoDB. I cannot forget to mention Express when speaking about a Node.js back end! I have the capability to link an Express server to a database and define API routes. When using GraphQL, I have experience integrating Apollo into the server. I follow standard CRUD operations through REST or achieve the similar results with queries and mutations.'

A few years ago, I decided to learn C++ to begin game development as a hobby. I learned the entire language on my own and firmly grasp concepts such as object-oriented programming, polymorphism, pointers/references, etc. The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) was also a substantial topic I focused on. STL taught me about many common data structures found in computer science such as dynamic arrays, lists, sets, and maps. I also went in depth on algorithms and big O notation, utilising search, insert, transform, remove, and sort functions with iterators.'
