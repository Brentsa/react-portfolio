## Description
Welcome to my personal programming portfolio (Some aliteration for you!). It is a single page application that was developed using React. Users can learn a little bit about me, view my portfolio of projects, check out my competencies, and download my resume. Feel free to connect with me to chat about anything related to software development! :)
